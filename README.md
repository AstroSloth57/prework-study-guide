# <Bootcamp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This project was designed to not only begin learning some of the basics of coding, but to use as a future study guide to review previously studied material. Throughout the process of this project I was able to learn the basic level of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. With this project now completed, I have both advanced my knowledge on code, as well as created a space I will be able to return to and review what I have learned in the future.
